# MAX30102-SPO2-Heart-Rate-Sensor-Arduino-Project-FIles
This repository contains several files related to integrating the MAX30102 SPO2/Heart Rate sensor into a working Arduino Project.

To incorporate the bluetooth module into the project I recommend using an microcontroller with a larger flash memory than the 328P, which is used in this project.
